        moreInfo: `It's not deja vu, this is the site you are on right now! After finishing my bootcamp, I set out to make a developer portfolio. I chose to host on GitHub Pages and build it out with ReactJS. It was important to me to build the features of this site from scratch, so the only library I ended up using was ReactIcons. The most difficult part of building this site from scratch was the responsive styling. CSS has always been a challenge for me and it felt like every minor change led to a refactoring catastrophe on the design side. I used tutorials from my Scrimba course and John Smilga to build the slider and the auto-scroll features. Overall, I'm very pleased with the outcome of this site. There are certainly still bugs, but I'm looking forward to learning more and applying new knowledge to make this site perfect.`,

I also learned how to integrate new dependencies in my apps with react-icons. A super fun, easy project to ease me into building more complex apps with React.`,

I ran into a few issues with data types, calculations that returned NaN, and determining when the calculations took place and rendered on the screen. But it was so easy to find simple solutions with a Google search and I ended up with a really useful and satisfying app.`,
