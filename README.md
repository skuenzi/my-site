# Sara Kuenzi Web Developer Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Tech Stack: React, Javascript, GH Pages

### Premise:

I needed a portfolio and it was important to me that I build it from scratch! I learned a ton on this project, particularly that sometimes workarounds are sometimes as good as it will get. I'm really happy with the result and I think it showcases some of my best work and my personality. I also focused on making the contact information easy to find and utilize - viewers can send me an email with just a click!

### Favorite features: 
### Portfolio carousel and modals
  - This feature was tricky and I had to look back at several tutorials from my Scrimba course (Karl Hadwen was the instructor for this project). But I was able to use those resources to build my own carousel and personalize it to exactly what I needed, including the descriptions on hover.
  - The modals needed to work with all screen sizes and have all the information a viewer could possibly want - a small but rewarding css challenge!
#### Auto-scroll feature
  - A single page application was all that was really necessary for this site, but I wanted to make sure navigating to particular sections was easy and smooth. So I decided to try an auto-scroll to take the user to each section with just a button click.
  - This is where a kind of strange workaround was needed - I had to use the total page height to calculate where the top of the screen should stop on scroll. It created a cluster of if statements, but it got the job done!
  - I would definitely like to revisit this eventually to find a simpler solution
